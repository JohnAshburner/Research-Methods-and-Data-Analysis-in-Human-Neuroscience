# Research Methods and Data Analysis in Human Neuroscience
Teaching material for the Research Methods and Data Analysis in Human Neuroscience module

* **Learning MATLAB**
  
    This tutorial cannot teach you everything about the MATLAB language, but the following should give you a flavour of the language (along with some concepts that generalise to other languages).
    * [Variables](variables.md). An introduction to MATLAB variables.
    * [Other Types](other_types.md). A few more types of variables.
    * [Structures and Cell Arrays](cells_and_structs.md). Ways to organise data in MATLAB.
    * [Control Flow](control_flow.md). Putting functions together with if/else statements and loops.
      
* **Linear Algebra**
  
    The array operations dealt with so far have not included matrix multiplications, matrix division, etc.
    Understanding some linear algebra will be essential for understanding the statistical analyses you do with the SPM software.
    * [Basic Linear Algebra](linear_algebra.md). The basic ideas relevant to fitting a linear combination of basis functions to a vector of data.

* **SPM Statistics**

    Now that you should understand a bit more about working with matrices, you can use this knowledge to understand more about how to statistically analyse fMRI data.
    * [Statistical Tests](linear_model.md). How t and F tests are implemented in SPM.
    * [Haemodynamic Modelling](haemodynamic_modelling.md). Modifications for working with fMRI data.
